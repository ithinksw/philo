Philo version 0.9.2 release notes
=================================

The primary focus of the 0.9.2 release was repairing the setuptools configuration so that Philo can be installed and updated reliably. In addition, a bug involving the use of :class:`DateTimeField` or :class:`DateField` as the field template for a :class:`JSONAttribute` has been fixed.
